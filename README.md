BookLink - A Book Sharing Platform

"Link the Story Forward"

ðŸ“š Introduction

BookLink is a web platform designed for book enthusiasts to share, borrow, and swap books with others nearby. It fosters a community of readers while promoting sustainable book usage.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Our goal is to create a seamless and engaging digital platform that connects book lovers, encouraging local book exchanges without the hassle of shipping.

ðŸš€ Problem Statement

Many people have books they no longer read, while others struggle to find affordable ways to access new ones.
